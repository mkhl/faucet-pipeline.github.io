What's with the name?
it's a portmanteau of "fejo asset pipeline" - inspired by both fejo.dk and the
Rails asset pipeline
If you absolutely must, it's also acceptable to capitalize the name (i.e.
"Faucet" or "Faucet Pipeline"; no hyphen there).

Do I need to understand transpilers?
sorta: should understand difference between bundling and transpiling, and why
having heard of Rollup and Babel helps too

How to do code splitting?
manually 'cause that's the way we like it
having said that, perhaps Rollup? contributions welcome

Why Rollup?
readable, straightforward source, tree shaking, comparatively easy to grok the concepts

Why constraints
separation of concerns: build system should not influence source and vice versa
replaceability

Why no minification?
View Source
GZIP good enough
bundles should be small anyway

Why no Sass globbing?

code splitting?
maybe Rollup; contributions welcome
